Investment Strategy Chatbot

This project is an advanced AIdriven chatbot designed to provide personalized investment advice based on user input. Built using Streamlit, Spacy, yfinance, and LLaMA, the chatbot extracts relevant investment preferences from natural language input, analyzes top stocks, and generates tailored recommendations.
Key Features
 Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes Spacy to extract key investment parameters like risk tolerance, investment horizon, and preferred sectors from user input.
 Stock Data Analysis: Fetches realtime stock data using yfinance and predicts future prices using time series models like ARIMA and SARIMA.
 Volatility Calculation: Analyzes stock volatility to filter out highrisk options based on user preferences.
 Personalized Investment Advice: Generates naturalsounding investment advice using LLaMA, tailored to the user's specific needs.
Technologies Used
 Streamlit: For creating the web interface.
 Spacy: For NLP tasks.
 yfinance: For fetching stock data.
 LLaMA: For generating natural language investment advice.
 Python Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn for data processing and analysis.
